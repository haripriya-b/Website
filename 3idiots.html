		The song begins with a cockerel crowing. With that yout sit up and wonder what the
		song is going to be like. Then enters Sonu Nigam humming like his usual self and then
		you sit back and enjoy the song which has a new flavor. A very fast peppy number which
		Sonu has sung with different tones and modulations. To add to the combination is Shaan
		which reminds you of Koi Kahe from Dil Chahta Hai... The local flavor with wistle sound,
		and the noise of beating vessel remonds you of a college set up.

		The song begins with the magical vioce of Shreya Ghoshal and then enters Sonu is yet another
		deadly combination. This song has been made for dancing and that too in the rain. Although the 
		tunes in between remind you of those in 70's and 80's it is quite catchy. Almost at the end,
		Shreya has sung in different modulation which is very western which makes you want to hum along.

	       <p class="para">
		A very soulful song... The lyrics explain the character of Aamir and how his friends are now
		searching for him. This song has Shantanu written on it as there is a hint of Bengali in it.
		Very little instruments used. Little bit of flute and beats are used in the background with 
		emphasis on the voice. The arrangements with the voice is however very inpressive. This song 
		will be liked when seen with the visuals.

	       <h2 class="heading"> Give Me Some Sunshine... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		This song begins with tunes on the guitar and anecdotes narrated by Sharman. The lyrics are 
		about youngsters not being allowed to live life the way they want to. Another song that is 
		visually inclined. The tune reminds one of Shankar - Ehsaan - Loy combination. But that could
		be because of the tunes on guitar.

	       <p class="para">
		One of the best renditions of Sonu, one would say. A very soulful and passionate song that 
		has been given life by the singer. Sonu has gone for a little higher pitch than he usually does.
		The lyrics are yet again wonderful. This song is about friendship. and friends standing up 
		for each other and not letting the other fail.

		Ranjith modulates his voice very suitably for this number! Andrea is limited to interludes and a bit of 
		humming but does a good job. The foot-tapping lead music hints of a number influenced heavily by western 
		music, but the blend of classical music with western beat in the background of the first interlude is 
		appreciable. Orchestration for the song is good. The lead line catches up instantly!

		DeviSri Prasad is his usual enthusiastic self in this song of a lover.The song has the right "oomph"
		that catches up with the target audience right away! The beat is good, the tune is catchy and typically 
		Devi's, and even reminds some of his previous numbers, including nuvvunTE nijamEgaa swapnam... from Arya 
		with a theme similar to this song.

		Srinivas is apt and sings with a pronunciation that reminds of Balu and S.P. Charan. Gopika sounds sweet 
		and perfect and sings with ease. The higher pitch of the concluding bit is impressive. The lead music is 
		good, and so is the flute bit there. The tune vaguely resembles some Ilayaraja numbers of the past 
		(aaDajanmaku enni SOkaalO... or sundari! nEnE nuvvanTa... from Dalapathi, for example.), seemingly due to 
		similarities in the raaga. The rich orchestra in the interlude seems to continue in Ilayaraja's scheme too.
		The song however catches up upon repeated hearing.

	       <p class="para">
		Murali and Naveen have voices that gel well. Naveen, however, mispronounces "La" as "la" several times! 
		Priya Prakash adds a little to the song, also with some flawed pronunciation. DeviSri can also be heard in 
		the song. The chorus bit "Love makes life beautiful!" marks the theme, of the movie too, maybe. The BGM is 
		good, and the beat goes hand in hand with it. The tune is just okay. This is more of a lyric-based song, being
		situational, and thus lesser emphasis on this aspect is condonable. The lines for female go classical way and 
		the beat goes along, but the music soon bridges the gap to the rest of the song nicely, through an applause.

		Sagar's modulation is touching and apt, but sounds very much like Devi himself as he delivers this pathos 
		number! Sumangali is melodious in the scant bits of interlude. The lead bit of humming lays the path to the 
		mood of the song. The tune is typically Devi-like and so is the orchestration, hinting of his work for Nuvvostanante
		Nenoddantana...! at times during the subsequent stanzas (charaNaalu).

		Actually, DeviSri takes off this song, and pops into interludes too, without taking credit for the same. 
		Siddharth is beautiful, active, and impeccable in his pronunciation and modulation! It's good to see a young, 
		non-native hero being a flawless singer too! The tune catches up with some hearing. The name DeviSri Prasad is written 
		all over the interludes! The flute is aptly used.

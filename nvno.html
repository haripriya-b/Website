		Shankar Mahadevan proves that he is a master in the higher ranges. This slow number, 
		which has some intermittent dialogues, has a dream-like quality and is redolent of dark 
		wintery nights. It is difficult to fall instantly in love with this song. But in the 
		fullness of time, it catches hold of you. The instrumentation has also an alluring appeal.

		This is straight out of S P Balasubramaniam's alley. He infuses all the right romantic pathos 
		in this song. He sounds the way he should. But the rhythm is almost old-fashioned. Yet, the 
		orchestration is otherwise okay. Nice song, but somehow lacks the generic appeal. The chorus in 
		background is haunting.

		Karthik begins slowly but comes into his own pretty fast. His voice stands the rigors while Sumangali,
		who is emerging as a talent to watch, gives him good company. The song itself is a bit confusing --- 
		in that it is fast-paced in some places, but inexplicably slows down in some other places. In the event
		, it is difficult to slot the song in a particular genre. The Goa-festival type chorus also doesn't fit 
		into the totality of the song.

		Nothing extraordinary about this bit sung by Sagar. It is about hero's love for the heroine. The pathos 
		comes through. But little else is there.

		It is difficult not to like Jassi Gift's voice. It is unconventionally vocal. His style, honed in church 
		choir, has a strange resonance. Its masculine appeal is also quaint. Listen to this song, you know why Jassi 
		Gift is so popular in South these days. Though he is constricted in style and range, he is good in his zone. 
		In this number, along with Kalpana, waltzes ever so easily. The catchy rhythm and peppy feel all make it a song 
		for the charts. Pick of the lot, by a long stretch.

		This is another mass song. However, the orchestration is not on the expected lines. It offers something new,and 
		Mallikarjun and Sagar have the vocal training to deliver the stuff.

		A sublime R & B type song. The tones of the 60s and the beats of Beatles come alive as the hard-working Tippu 
		belts this zinger of a song with verve and vivacity. The western influences in the song are obvious. But all 
		the same it is enjoyable and you feel like breaking into a twist dance. the joi de vivre in the number is 
		certainly infectious. The orchestration, especially towards the end, is also inspired.

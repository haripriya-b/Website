	       <h2 class="heading"> Bad Romance... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		Lady Gaga lets the love monsters out of the closet and they are stepping to a martial beat. If you 
		had any fears that Gaga would be a one album flash in the pan, the room filling beats and melodies of 
		"Bad Romance" should help dispel them. The song is an intense litany of nearly pathological romantic 
		entanglements all set to beats designed to crowd the dance floor. Lady Gaga's singing is at its best so 
		far here as she moves from snarling threats to floating sweetness and back again.

	       <h2 class="heading">Poker Face... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		"Poker Face" works well on pop radio, but with slight mixing alterations it would be equally at home in a 
		dark, sweaty, late night party atmosphere. She has refreshed the pop world in the US and UK at one of the 
		slowest times of the year. "Poker Face" keeps the motors humming as everyone waits for the next step forward 
		from Lady GaGa.

	       <h2 class="heading"> Paparazzi... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		"Paparazzi" is the fourth single from Lady GaGa's debut album The Fame. Despite the pheonomenal comercial 
		success of her three earlier singles, this is easily the top artistic achievement yet. Bathed in warm chords 
		that communicate a swirl of emotion, the song is a tribute of sorts to the symbiotic but ultimately fake and 
		"plastic" relationship between stars and their trailing paparazzi. The accompanying music video takes the song 
		to another level entirely.

	    <div class="columns">
	       <h2 class="heading"> The Edge of Glory... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		There is a poignant story behind "The Edge of Glory" about Lady Gaga and her father coping with the impending 
		death of her grandfather. Once again very personal life experiences have generated pop magic for Lady Gaga. 
		Lyrically, there is little complication here, but the sound utilizes the power of classic rock. A big saxophone 
		solo from Clarence Clemons of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band appears to drive that message home. Lady Gaga's 
		roots may be in dance music, but she also clearly knows how to rock.

	    <div class="wcolumns">
	       <h2 id="heading">Telephone... </h2>
	       <p id="para">
		Lyrically, "Telephone" comes off just a bit silly. Lady Gaga has said in interviews it is about fear of suffocation by 
		someone who continually calls to encourage her to work harder. However, the words themselves seem to amount to, essentially, 
		"Geez, my cell phone is annoying, I would rather just dance." The line, "I left my head and my heart on the dance floor" 
		does remind us that Lady Gaga has helped pull the entire pop music enterprise onto the dance floor in a way we have possibly 
		not seen since the heyday of disco.

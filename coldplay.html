	       <p class="para">
		"Viva La Vida" soars in with a grandiose instrumental arrangement and sweeping lyrics detailing the pain 
		of being deposed from a lofty position. The big sound of the song constantly verges on becoming overblown, 
		but Coldplay know how to walk the tightrope perfectly. Bells and chimes and orchestral swells are all there 
		on the chorus, but Chris Martin's voice still pierces through like a clarion call. Lyrically, the pain of the 
		protagonist is clear, but the sweep of words about Jerusalem bells, Roman cavalry, and Saint Peter give "Viva 
		La Vida" an air of intelligence rare in today's most popular pop songs.

	       <p class="para">
		With every album release, the music critics are amazed as Coldplay just get better and better, but I don't think
 		there'll be any topping this truly anthemic song. A ballad that's as fragile as they come to start off with, the 
		song turns into a truly epic lighters-in-the-air anthem before dropping down back to nothing at the end (in a moment 
		that has festival crowds pretty much taking over from Chris for the last chorus).

	       <h2 class="heading"> Paradise... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		The huge opening fanfare of "Paradise" is simply gorgeous. However, the rest of the song does not quite hold up. There 
		are so many echoes here of other work by Coldplay that, just like the protagonist of the song longing for something better, 
		we are left longing to hear other classic songs by the band.

	    <div class="columns">
	       <h2 class="heading">Clocks... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		Certainly one of the highlights from "A Rush Of Blood To The Head", Coldplay's "Clocks" is particularly effective
		thanks to the beautiful and memorable piano motif throughout. Chris Martin's vocals accompany this well, but the drums 
		and guitars do not combine together as well as they could have, and as such "Clocks" lacks the edge Coldplay classics such as "Yellow" 
		and "The Scientist" have possessed.

	       <p class="para">
		It's a soft beginning for 'Mera Jeena Hai Kya' that has Pritam's brother-in-arm Neeraj Shridhar 
		coming behind the mike. The mood is totally different from what one 
		has heard of this combo in the past as the composer-singer 'jodi' gets into a lovey-dovey outing 
		that has a soft rock base to it. Written by Sameer, the song sees an interspersion of 
		English lyrics as well. A song about a protagonist who is looking forward to a better life
		due to arrival of his loved on, 'Mera Jeena Hai Kya' (which also appears in the 'remix version',
		just as most of the other songs in the album do) just about manages to be passable.

	       <p class="para">
		There is something peppier that comes along in the form of 'Dilkash Dildaar Duniya'. 
		Even though the beginning is a little 90s with hint of Kumar Sanu/Babul Surpiyo 
		tracks from the era gone by, 'Dilkash Dildaar Duniya' settles down to an extent once
		the song title makes an appearance. Yet another love song with an urban base to it, 
		this one does have good energy that ensures that Aashayein manages to hang on. With 
		Tulsi Kumar as the female voice behind the song, this Kumaar written track (appearing 
		later in the 'remix version) too doesn't turn out to be that one chartbuster which could 
		have helped Aashayein cover some distance.

	       <h2 class="heading"> Rabba... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		It was just a few weeks back when a song titled 'Rabba' had arrived as a part of a 
		non-film album. The same song is now heard in 'Aashayein' with Shiraz Uppal singing as 
		well as composing it. The song sticks to the mood of the album and turns out to be one 
		of the better numbers that one has heard so far. Of course this song too doesn't belong
		to the world of Bollywood and continues the non-filmy flavour of the album. A Shakeel 
		Sohail written track, it makes for a decent hearing but that's about it.

	       <h2 class="heading"> Ab Mujko Jeena... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		The soft rock flavour continues with composers Salim-Suleiman and lyricist Mir Ali Husain
		taking over the album from this point on. First of their compositions here is 'Ab Mujhko 
		Jeena' which reminds one of the non-film songs from the 90s. A song about looking up in 
		life, it aims at being spirited and hence reminds of the sound of Iqbal, a film which again 
		had Nagesh Kukunoor at the helm of affairs. As one realises by this point in the album, the 
		songs are mainly meant for adding on to the background score rather than being the kind that
		would be chartbusters in isolation.

	    <div class="wcolumns">
	       <h2 class="heading">Shukriya Zindagi... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		Next to arrive is Shafqat Amanat Ali who sings yet another solo track which goes as 'Shukriya 
		Zindagi'. Just like most of the other numbers in the album, this one too is about thanking life 
		for being beautiful, something which is the core essence of Aashayein. This time around, the 
		song moves at a relatively slower pace and is far more attached to the Indian roots. No, you can't
		be heard singing around this track or dancing to its 'remix version' but its 'sad version' may just 
		work for those who like their films to over overtly emotional.

	    <div class="columns">
	       <h2 class="heading"> Pal Mein Mila Jahan... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		The saddest song in the album is 'Pal Mein Mila Jahan' which reminds one of the kind of compositions
		that were created in the 60s. This song about finding happiness and loosing it subsequently comes in 
		two versions - one by Shankar Mahadevan and another by Shreya Ghoshal. However, yet again the song is 
		only for the film's narrative. Also, its inherent sad appeal means that it would find very few takers 
		and that too only after audience has seen the film.

	    <div class="wcolumns">
	       <h2 class="heading">Chala Aaya Pyar... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		Last to arrive is Mohit Chauhan's 'Chala Aaya Pyar' which carries on the sad mood that has been created 
		in the album. In fact one realises that while the start of Aashayein was still on a relatively happier 
		note, the latter part takes a pensive route; something that doesn't quite end the album on a happy note.

	       <p class="para">
		The song is tuned well with the spirit of Mahesh's image.  Thaman's instruments acquire a stentorian hue 
		and though there is not much to write about the appeal, it does remind of Mani Sharma's Athadu style.  
		Shankar Mahadevan's voice is somehow lost in the loudness of music.  All in all, the song is good as the title
 		track for a hero of Mahesh's grand stature.

	       <h2 class="heading">Guruvaram... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		The song is a disappointment.  Guruvaram is a cross between two or three previous tunes of Thaman.  Positively, 
		Rama Jhogaya Sastry's lyrics capture the madness of a guy who has jusst fallen in love.  The very many English 
		rhyming words remind us of the Picchiga number from Magadheera.

	       <p class="para">
		The lyricist plays with unheard of words (or, words from another language may be) to win over us with initial appeal,
 		but then the music fails to captivate twenty seconds into the song.  If Karthik's voice has that routine dash of 
		mischievousness, it is Rita's crooning that adds life to this otherwise run-of-the-mill song.

	       <p class="para">
		The song is mediocrity typified.  Neither the lyrics nor Thaman's illogical tinkering with the legendary Monika ditty 
		from another age somewhere in the middle manage to redeem this 'item song'.  The belle may have her tensions, but why 
		spoil for peace of mind with her litany of complaints, voiced by uncreative lyrics?

	       <p class="para">
		Lyrics are suggestively sensuous.  The touch of voyeurism aside, Dethadi has not got anything.  Thaman seems to be 
		trying to connect with the mass audience, but then he flounders from the word go by coming up with nothing imaginative.

	       <h2 class="heading"> Adara Adara Adaragottu... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		If this marriage song has been filmed on the sets of a mantap (which is very much likely that it has been), it will 
		irritate the audience to no end.  We bet!  Adara sounds characteristically noisy and incongrous.  Usually, the lyrics 
		should have salvaged such a song, but Sastry's pen fails here.

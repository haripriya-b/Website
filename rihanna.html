	       <h2 class="heading"> Umbrella... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		Umbrella is unique in that it is constructed of a hip-hop beat but has an edgy rock
		sound. The song is somewhat stripped-down and consists mostly of a standard drumbeat 
		up until the chorus. At the hook, however, Rihanna kicks her vocal up a notch alongside 
		a roaring bass line, creating an aura of desperation, as if the whole thing could explode 
		at any moment. The experience culminates in Rihannas catchy, repetitive pronunciation of the songs title.

		Although Umbrella kicks off with an unnecessary and somewhat uninspired rap from label boss
 		Jay-Z, Rihanna more than makes up for the early misstep as she convincingly sings about keeping a 
		relationship together no matter the circumstances.

	       <p class="para">
		Few major recording artists can truly send chills up the spine when you listen to their words, and 
		Eminem has that gift. What could have been a somewhat standard rant about the pain and lies that 
		take place as a relationship crumbles becomes chilling when the opening of the chorus matches the 
		end of the final verse. Eminem, with an assist from Rihanna, proves once again why he is considered 
		a truly legendary performer.

	       <h2 class="heading"> Russian Roulette... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		"Russian Roulette" will never be the crowd-pleaser that Rihanna's mega-hit "Umbrella" is. However, 
		it is a work of gorgeous melancholy and dread. Frequent collaborator Ne-Yo helps take Rihanna into 
		uncompromisingly adult territory in the wake of the domestic violence in her relationship with Chris Brown. 
		"Russian Roulette" is dark, but there is beauty here as well. This is one of the more memorable of Rihanna's 
		growing list of major pop hits.

	       <h2 class="heading"> Unfaithful... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		Rihanna's voice is not particularly strong. There are points here at which it sounds thin and reedy. However, 
		her songs are all about projecting personality and reflecting the lives of young women and men in their late 
		teens like herself. To adult ears, "Unfaithful" may seem all rather overwrought. However, to a teenager these 
		matters of the heart feel like life and death, and Rihanna, with the help of Ne-Yo, has captured those emotions 
		on "Unfaithful."

	    <div class="wcolumns">
	       <h2 class="heading">Only Girl (In the World)... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		Rihanna does not possess the most technically impressive voice of female pop singers. However, it is one of the 
		most distinctive in the music industry. Early on it might have been easy to dismiss much of her success as being 
		tied to the producers and songwriters who helped put together her pop confections. However, now with 15 top 10 
		singles under her belt and a 16th assuredly on her way, it is time to give Rihanna credit for being an arresting 
		performer who has proven herself on material ranging from club stomper to ballad and icy stoicism to warm, enveloping 
		romance. "Only Girl (In the World)" is another stellar moment in a phenomenal pop career.

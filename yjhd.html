	       <p class="para">
		Sung by Benny Dayal and Shefali Alvaris. Get ready to groove to the number as its 
		fast beats will definitely pull you to the dance floor! The young, peppy and crazy 
		tune justifies the title of the movie. The peppy lyrics are in sync with the mood. 
		Thoroughly enjyable.

	       <p class="para">
		Nowadays Holi songs are a rarity and "Balam Pichkari", sung by Vishal Dadlani and 
		Shalmali Kholgade, is one of those rare songs. The naughty number would make you dance.
		The lyrics are witty. It starts on a high note and ends on a high note. A must hear!

	       <h2 class="heading"> Dilliwaali Girlfriend... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		Sung by Arijit Singh and Sunidhi Chauhan. It may not be as perfect as the first two 
		numbers, but the element of fun and naughitiness is intact in this one too! If the 
		title has the word Dilli in it, then Punjabi element has to be there. The rap, in the 
		beginning of the song, is impressive and lyrics are fun. However after a point it 
		looses its grip.

	       <h2 class="heading"> Gargra... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		An interesting duet by Rekha Bhardwaj and Vishal Dadlani. It has a touch of local
		'tamasha' and Rekha's voice sings the song in her typical way. With whistles and 
		ghungroo sounds, the singers make it a fun number. The lyrics are worth paying 
		attention to.

	       <h2 class="heading">Ilahi... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		After all these dance tracks, the album takes a regional turn with "Ilahi". A simple
		song, sung by Arijit. It has a chorus by children singing in background brings freshness
		to it. There is another version version of the song called "Ilahi reprised". It's 
		faster than the original, otherwise the rest of the elements are similar to the 
		original.

	    <div class="columns">
	       <h2 class="heading"> Kabira... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		Rekha Bharadwaj nad Tochi Raina come together for "Kabira". The music is liberating
		Tochi sings beautifully. It's a kind of song that grows on you. Not a very long number
		, it keeps the essenceof the song intact. Another version of the song is "Kabira Encore"
		. Sung by Harshdeep Kaur and Arijit, it is way far better than the previous one. Set
		in the backdrop of a wedding, it is blissfully rhythemic and beautiful. You would want
		to hear the song again and again for the way Arijit has sung it.

	       <h2 class="heading">Subhanallah... </h2>
	       <p class="para">
		A usual romantic number, talking about the beauty of a woman. It will woo diehard romantics.
		Sreeram takes the mike for the song, which may not appeal so much to others.
